# SQLZoo

> These are SQL exercises taken from the http://sqlzoo.net website.

SQL Zoo is a website that helps you in a very didactic way get in touch with the basics of Databases, in special MySQL commands. There are several exercises that you have to solve, and by doing that you get confortable with commands such as JOIN and SELECT that will help you query information and deal with huge sets of data. This is an absolute must for web-developers, in special those who will work with back-end.
